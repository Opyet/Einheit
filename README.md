# Einheit

Unity is power, and the greatest power of change is in unity. Einheit is a metaverse project that thrives on the power of a more decentralized world where unity for community benefit is rewarded over division and chaos.

Einheit combines aspects of Gaming, NFTs, DeFi, Marketplace and DAO to deliver an immersive and engageming metaverse GameFi platform and community.

# User Story

* User creates a personal avatar with a base entry fee. How much?
* User buys enough governance token (25) as payment to mint UGC NFT. DAI goes into the treasury. (We will have to list gov token/DAI on an exchange??)
* User creates UGC NFT of beneficial content to the community.
* Other users can see the avatar of the originating user and his NFT. Using the governance token (2), and without knowledge of the existing votes count, they will validate/vote whether it is beneficial or not.
* (Max vote count will be adjustable as the community grows).
* When the max vote is reached, users with the correct vote will earn more governance tokens.
* User with originating UGC will receive more governance tokens and in addition have his avatar label change further towards the central chosen colour of honour/status.
* UGCs keep generating gov tokens for originators as long as other users validate that the information is very beneficial.
* Users that validate wrongly will lose their gov tokens. (This helps us to control token supply)
